# CLI reference

Every command documents itself: `hey <command> --help` shows its usage, flags and
examples, and `hey commands` lists the whole catalog. This page is the narrative that the
help text does not carry: how the output formats fit together, how IDs flow from one
command to the next, and what HEY does with each write.

## Help and reference

The root help groups commands by the work they do and keeps the common output flags concise:

```bash
hey --help                # browse the command summary
hey compose --help        # see a command's usage, flags, and examples
hey commands              # list the complete executable command catalog
```

Cross-cutting references are available as help topics:

```bash
hey help output            # output formats, selectors, and jq filtering
hey help exit-codes        # stable process exit statuses
hey help environment       # supported HEY_* environment variables
hey help linked-accounts   # account selection and precedence
```

## Setup

`hey setup` runs the first-run wizard again at any time: browser sign-in, a check of who
you are signed in as, and connecting the coding agents it detects (Claude Code, Codex).
`--skip-agents` leaves agent integrations unchanged and `--skip-omarchy` leaves the
Omarchy integration unchanged. `--silent-success` keeps any required sign-in visible,
shows an installation spinner, and ends a successful run with `SETUP COMPLETE`; failure
guidance is still shown.

At a terminal, a logged-out data command (`hey box list`, say) offers to sign you in on
the spot. Piped or `--json` runs never prompt: they fail with `Not logged in` (exit 3) so
scripts and agents can handle it.

## Authentication

```bash
# Browser-based OAuth against HEY's own OAuth server (primary method)
hey auth login

# Or use a pre-generated token
hey auth login --token TOKEN

# Or use a browser session cookie
hey auth login --cookie COOKIE
```

Tokens refresh automatically on expiry. Credentials are stored in the system keyring (with file fallback at `~/.config/hey-cli/credentials.json`).

```bash
hey auth status   # check auth status
hey auth token    # print the bearer token for scripting (refuses a --cookie login)
hey auth refresh  # force token refresh
hey auth logout   # clear credentials
```

`hey login` and `hey logout` are top-level shortcuts for `hey auth login` and `hey auth logout`.

### Linked accounts

One HEY login exposes every mail account linked to that identity. List the available
filters, persist a default, or select one for a single invocation:

```bash
hey account list                 # list All Accounts and each linked account
hey account use 12345            # persist a linked account as the default mail filter
hey account use all              # return to All Accounts
hey --account 12345 boxes         # override the default for one invocation
HEY_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 hey search "quarterly planning"
```

The default is `all`. Selection precedence is `--account`, `HEY_ACCOUNT_ID`, trusted local
`.hey/config.json`, the global default for the active server, then All Accounts. Global
account defaults are stored separately for each server origin, so development and production
selections cannot affect one another. Explicit and persisted IDs are validated against the
signed-in identity before mail requests, so an unavailable account fails closed.

The first command that would use a repository-local server or account setting asks whether to
use it once, always trust its current values, or cancel. Non-interactive and JSON commands fail
closed until you explicitly run `hey config trust-local` from that directory. Changes to the
local server or account invalidate trust. Review trust with `hey config trusted-locals` and
remove it with `hey config untrust-local`.

Compose and contact creation use an individually selected account; replies and forwards use
the thread's account. Calendars, todos, habits, time tracking, and journal entries remain
identity-wide.

## Output formats

Structured data commands support `--json` for full output and `--jq '<expression>'` to
filter that output without an external `jq` binary. `--jq` implies `--json` and filters
the full success envelope; combine it with `--quiet` to filter result data directly.
Errors retain their complete structured envelope. Commands with dedicated raw output
(`hey auth token`, `hey shell-completion generate`, `hey setup`, `hey skill`, `hey tui`,
and `hey --version`) reject `--jq`.

Use `--base-url` to override the server URL and `--account <id|all>` to select a linked
mail account.

```bash
hey box list --jq '.data[] | {id, name}'
hey box list --quiet --jq '.[].id'
```

Listing commands also answer `--markdown` for a table, `--styled` to force the human
rendering when the output is piped, `--ids-only` for one ID per line, and `--count` for a
bare number. `--ids-only` and `--count` need list data, so they work on `hey box list`,
`hey box view`, `hey bundle view`, `hey label list`, `hey label view`, `hey collection list`, `hey collection view`,
`hey workflow list`, `hey workflow view`, `hey clip list`, `hey snippet list`, `hey draft list`, `hey search`, `hey contact list`, `hey contact threads`, `hey screener list`, `hey screener history`, `hey calendar list`,
`hey event list`, `hey event day`, `hey event week`, `hey todo list`, `hey habit list`,
`hey timetrack list` and `hey journal list`.
The
data-only formats print any pagination notice on stderr, so the IDs on stdout stay
pipeable. `hey clip list --ids-only` and `--count` cover the newest page only because the
released SDK does not expose HEY's cursor for older clip pages.

`--html` writes the original HTML, for the commands that hold some: `hey thread read`,
`hey journal read`, `hey contact show` and `hey contact note show`. It is a format of
its own — it cannot be combined with the other output flags (`--stats` included: there is
no envelope to carry stats), every other command refuses it, and it is meant for a file or
a pipe: on a terminal it is refused with the redirect spelled out, since markup on a
terminal is neither readable nor safe.

A thread is written as one HTML5 document, so a downstream tool can parse it rather than
split it: `<!doctype html>`, `<html lang="en">`, a `<head>` with `<meta charset="utf-8">`
and `<title>Thread N</title>`, then in `<body>` one
`<article id="entry-ID" data-entry-id="ID" data-created-at="…" data-body-state="…">` per
entry, oldest first. Each article opens with a `<header>` naming the sender and the date
(HTML-escaped) and then holds the entry's HTML exactly as HEY served it. An entry without
a body holds only its header, and `data-body-state` says why — `bodyless` when HEY served
none, `over_limit` or `failed` when the load left it unread, `hydrated` when it was read
and was empty. A thread that could only be read in part is refused as for every other
format; with `--allow-partial` the document ends with the notice in an HTML comment
(`<!-- notice: … -->`) just before `</body>`, and the notice goes to stderr as well.

A single body — a journal entry, a contact's note — is written as a fragment instead: the
HTML as HEY served it, nothing for an empty one. A thread has entries to frame; one body
is what gets pasted into something else.

## Email

Resource commands use one noun-first family: `box`, `label`, `collection`, `workflow`,
`clip`, and `snippet`, with actions such as `list` and `view` underneath. The earlier
plural listing forms and direct detail forms remain supported for compatibility; `hey
commands --json` identifies each plural form with `compatibility_for` while the primary
help and examples show the canonical family. `list` and `view` are reserved action names
under `box`; a box with either display name is addressed explicitly (`hey box view list`)
or through the direct-form escape (`hey box -- list`).

```bash
hey box list                         # list mailboxes
hey box view imbox                   # list email threads in a box (by name or ID)

```

`hey thread read` reads a whole thread, oldest entry first, however many pages HEY serves it in — within limits it states: a hundred pages past the first, two thousand entries, as many bodies, 64 MiB of content and two minutes in all. A thread that could only be read in part — a body HEY would not serve, a limit reached — is refused rather than passed off as whole; `--allow-partial` takes what was read, with a `notice` saying what is missing and each entry's `body_state` saying whether its body was `hydrated`, `bodyless` (HEY served none), `over_limit` or `failed`. `--count` and `--ids-only` read the entry index and no bodies, so only a truncated index can make them partial. `--markdown` writes the thread as one Markdown document — a heading per entry naming the sender, date and ID, then the body — which is the shape to hand an agent or a notes app. `hey attachment list` reads the bodies in every format, since that is where attachment metadata lives, and answers a partial thread the same way. `hey reply` answers the thread's latest entry and addresses the reply the way HEY does: it asks HEY for the reply's recipients — everyone that entry was addressed to, its sender moved onto the To line, and your own addresses, aliases and catch-alls excluded — falling back to computing them from the entry when that read is unavailable.

Email bodies come back as Markdown. `hey thread read` and the TUI render that Markdown for the terminal — headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, tables and code survive, and links keep their URLs and stay clickable where the terminal supports it. `--json` carries the same Markdown in `body`, so an agent reading a thread sees the structure a human sees rather than a flattened wall of text. `--html` still returns HEY's original HTML.

Writing is Markdown too, everywhere text goes in: `-m`, `--content`, `--note`, positional content, stdin, and `$EDITOR` (which opens prefilled with the existing entry or note as Markdown). Every such flag has a raw-HTML twin — `--message-html`, `--content-html`, `--note-html` — for sending markup verbatim; each pair is mutually exclusive. The TUI's compose and bulk-reply forms convert Markdown the same way, and the compose editor renders it live as you type — `**bold**` turns bold, markers and all. A fenced code block's language (` ```ruby `) is carried the way HEY's own editor stores it, so the web app syntax-highlights it.

Drafts are the review-before-send lane: `hey compose --draft` (and `hey reply --draft`) saves instead of sending — recipients optional on a draft — and answers the draft's ID. `hey draft show` reads it back with the body as Markdown, `hey draft edit` revises it (each flag replaces its field; what is not flagged is kept, by reading the draft and resending the whole of it, since a revision is not a patch on HEY's side), `hey draft send` delivers through HEY's undo window, and `hey draft delete` trashes it. Scheduling a delivery is done in a HEY app for now — the API cannot yet name an exact instant — and a schedule set there survives CLI edits untouched. A draft prepared here is reviewed and sent from any HEY app, which is the workflow this is for: an agent writes, a person decides.

`hey share <thread_id>` gets a sharing link for a thread. Anyone with the link can see the entire thread and future emails or replies sent to it. `hey unshare <thread_id>` turns off the sharing link.

Search accepts free text plus `--required`, `--any`, `--none`, `--exact`, `--from`, `--to`, `--subject`, `--date`, `--in`, `--label`, and `--attachment`. `--in`, `--date`, `--label` and `--attachment` take one of the values `hey search filters` lists — the attachment kinds are `any`, `images`, `pdfs`, `calendar_invites`, `documents`, `spreadsheets`, `presentations`, `media` and `zip_files`, so it is `--attachment pdfs` rather than `pdf`, and an unrecognized `--in`, `--date` or `--attachment` is refused with the values it accepts before anything is sent. Use `--page` for one page or `--all` to fetch up to 100 pages; capped searches report the next page for continuation. Search results include `topic_id` for reading the thread and the matching message summaries. Results with an active box item also include `id` for organization actions.

Contact updates preserve omitted name, email, and alias fields. Supplying `--alias` replaces the complete alias list; `--alias=` clears it. Contact notes accept positional content, `--note`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`. HEY hides contacts rather than permanently deleting them; hidden contacts leave lists, autocomplete, and search, and can be shown again by ID. Bundling groups a contact's mail into one row without merging or deleting the underlying threads; unbundling lists those threads separately again. HEY applies bundling when the contact's current delivery setting supports bundles.

The Screener is where first-time senders wait. `hey screener list` returns clearance IDs — not contact IDs — with the sender and the subject of what they sent, plus `topic_id` for reading the thread before deciding. `--count` asks for the number alone, which is a far cheaper request than the queue, and prints it as a bare number like every other command's `--count`, so `n=$(hey screener list --count)` reads it directly. Approving delivers everything the sender has waiting; denying hides it. Either is reversible with the opposite command, and `hey screener history` shows what was already decided. Both listings page the way `hey box view` does: `--all` follows HEY's cursor to the end of the queue (up to 100 pages), and a single-page or capped read reports `next_page` in its JSON meta, which `--page <next_page>` continues from — the cursor is opaque, so a page *number* does not name a position. `hey screener list` also reports `total_count`, the whole queue's size, next to what the read returned. `--box` and `--seen` approve one sender at a time; several IDs go through HEY's bulk endpoint, which takes neither. `--spam` also trains HEY's filter, which is harder to undo than denying. `hey screener clear` empties the queue without deciding anything — those senders reappear on their next email.

`hey bulk-reply preview` is read-only and resolves each posting to its latest replyable entry. `hey bulk-reply send` resolves the selection again, skips threads without a replyable entry, keeps HEY's server-provided name tag, and returns the exact reply count, delivery ID, delayed state, undo URL, and undo command. Posting IDs must be positive and unique. The message can come from `-m`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`; `--attach` is repeatable.

A new message from `hey compose` — sent or saved with `--draft` — ends with the sender's HEY name tag, appended the way HEY's own compose form does; HEY puts the tag into the form rather than onto the saved message, so the CLI carries it itself. `--no-name-tag` leaves it off. With `--from`, the tag is the chosen identity sender's. A reply does not carry one yet.

Connect-an-Address and other alternate From identities appear on `hey senders list` — the `senders[]` from `GET /identity.json`, not the linked mail accounts `hey account list` names. Pass one to `hey compose --from <email>` or `hey reply <thread-id> --from <email>` to set `acting_sender_id`; an unknown address is refused with the available senders listed.

`--attach` is repeatable on `hey compose`, `hey reply`, and `hey bulk-reply send`, and attachment-only messages are supported. The CLI validates and uploads every file before sending the email. `hey attachment list <thread-id>` returns every named downloadable file, including named inline images. Direct files keep stable message-and-position IDs such as `456:1`; files inside embedded HTML receive opaque IDs scoped to their message. Pass either returned ID to `hey attachment save`. Saving uses the original filename by default, accepts `--output` for a file or directory, and preserves existing files unless `--force` is set.

Organization actions take the `id` values returned by `hey box view --json`, `hey label view --json`, or `hey search --json`. Reading, replying to, and forwarding a thread take its `topic_id` instead, which `hey box view --json`, `hey label view --json`, `hey collection view --json` and `hey search --json` all carry alongside `id`. `hey box view` also returns `next_page` and accepts `--page <next_page>` to continue a box listing; it keeps `next_history_url` for the sync clients that read it, and `--page` accepts that URL as readily as the cursor inside it. Label IDs come from `hey label list`; `hey label view` returns `next_page` and `total_count`, accepts `--page <next_page>` for continuation, and supports `--all` for complete traversal. HEY creates a label while adding it to at least one thread, so `hey label create` requires thread item IDs.

Collection IDs come from `hey collection list`. `hey collection view` returns both each posting `id` and its `topic_id`, plus `next_page` and `total_count`. Collection membership commands take `topic_id`; posting organization commands continue to take `id`. Creating a collection returns a confirmed mutation, and `hey collection list` provides its ID for subsequent commands. Collection updates accept a non-empty name, summary, or both.

Set Aside groups have no name in HEY; a group is its ID and its threads. `hey set-aside view` lists the same threads as `hey box view set-aside` and adds each thread's `box_group_id` (a `Group` column in the styled table). HEY's group index answers with IDs alone, so `hey set-aside group list` reads each group once for its thread count. `hey set-aside group view <group-id>` lists a group's threads with `next_page` and `total_count`, accepts `--page <next_page>` and `--all` like the other listings, and answers `not_found` for a group that is gone; HEY removes a group itself once its last thread leaves it. `group create`, `group add` and `group remove` take posting `id` values; `group view`, `group add --to` and `group delete` take a group ID from `group list`. `hey set-aside group create` and `hey set-aside group add` move threads into Set Aside if they are elsewhere, and then complete the move the way `hey move --to set-aside` does: the thread is marked seen, which also clears a bubble-up, since HEY keeps "bubbled up" as a seen state rather than a flag and a thread cannot be set aside and bubbled up at once. A group HEY refuses fails the command before any thread is changed. `hey set-aside group remove` leaves threads in Set Aside outside any group, while `hey set-aside group delete` sends the group's threads to Previously Seen, which is what HEY does when a group is dissolved in the web app.

Workflow IDs come from `hey workflow list`, which includes the linked account ID for each workflow. `hey workflow view <id>` returns stages in position order; `--ids-only` and `--count` apply to those stages. Creating a workflow needs one linked mail account, selected with `--account` when more than one is available. HEY creates new stages as `Untitled`, so create the stage, read its ID with `hey workflow view <id>`, then rename it. Workflow membership commands take `topic_id`. Adding a thread creates its workflow membership before selecting the requested stage; if stage selection fails, the thread remains in the workflow's first stage and the command reports the error.

Clips are passages saved from existing email entries. `hey clip list` lists the selected account's newest page with each clip's source entry and thread context; its JSON `notice` and the data-only formats' stderr make that boundary explicit because the released SDK does not expose HEY's cursor for older pages. `hey clip create <entry-id> --content <text>` verifies that the passage is source-backed by text carried in the entry, including embedded inbound email bodies. It accepts whitespace differences while preserving the supplied text exactly for HEY's web UI; passages are capped at 64 KiB and source-message validation at 1 MiB. HEY's web UI remains authoritative for stylesheet-driven visibility. HEY assigns a created clip to its source entry's account and resolves deletion by identity-owned clip ID across linked accounts; `--account` selects list presentation. `hey clip delete <clip-id>` removes it. Clip content is plain text; the source entry ID comes from `hey thread read --json`.

Snippets are named reusable email content, separate from clips saved out of received messages. `hey snippet list` lists both plain text and HEY's rich-text HTML; `hey snippet create`, `update`, and `delete` manage them. A create requires a non-empty name and content. Updates change whichever non-empty fields are supplied, while omitted fields stay as they are. In the TUI, Ctrl+T opens the picker from new-message, reply, and forward forms and inserts the snippet's plain-text representation at the current body cursor without replacing the draft.

`hey box view <name|id>`, `hey label view <id>` and `hey collection view <id>` list the same postings and answer the same formats: `--json`, `--styled`, `--markdown`, `--ids-only`, and `--count`. The data-only formats print the pagination notice and any `next_page` cursor on stderr, so the IDs on stdout stay pipeable. `--json` differs only in what wraps the postings: a box answers with HEY's box payload, a label and a collection with the source and its `total_count`.

Move destinations are Imbox, The Feed, Set Aside, Reply Later, or Paper Trail. Reply Later is a box rather than a separate flag: moving a Reply Later thread to Imbox removes Reply Later, preserves its seen state, and leaves a seen thread in Previously Seen. It does not return the thread to the box it occupied before Reply Later. Bubble Up has its own commands: `hey bubble up` raises a thread right away with `--now`, on a date with `--on` (HEY resurfaces it at its morning hour of that day, or its evening hour when the date is today), or at the morning hour of tomorrow, Saturday, or next Monday with `--tomorrow`, `--weekend`, and `--next-week`; `hey bubble pop` cancels one. `hey bubble list` shows both buckets — the threads back in the Imbox after bubbling up and the ones still scheduled, each with when it resurfaces. Trashing a shared thread removes your access instead of deleting it for everyone. Ignored threads remain in their box and can be restored with `hey stop-ignoring`.

## Watching for changes

```bash
hey watch                               # follow every box and calendar, a line of JSON per change
hey watch --box imbox --events added    # only new postings in the Imbox (calendars off)
hey watch --events recording_added,recording_updated,recording_deleted   # calendar changes only
hey watch --box imbox --exit-on-first   # block until something lands, then exit
hey watch --since 2026-08-18T09:00:00Z  # catch up from a time first, then follow
hey watch --box imbox --events new      # new mail only: unseen, unmuted, active since the watch began
hey watch --box imbox --events new --exit-on-first   # block until new mail
hey watch --box imbox --events new --run-async 'notify-send -a HEY "New mail in HEY"'
hey watch --run-sync ./triage.sh        # one at a time, waiting for each
```

Runs until interrupted, printing changes as they happen, one line each:

```json
{"change":"added","at":"2026-08-18T09:14:22.031Z","box":{"id":24088,"kind":"imbox","name":"Imbox"},"posting_id":98765,"thread_id":54321,"new":true,"posting":{}}
```

Every `added` and `updated` line says whether the posting is new mail: unseen, not muted,
and active since the watch last saw the thread — or since the watch began, for a thread it
has not seen, so a box's backlog is never new. Reading, muting or moving a thread is not new
activity; a reply on a known thread is. `--events new` selects the new ones, alone or in a
union with `added`, `updated`, `deleted` and `resync` — the default is everything but `new`,
and `new` alone leaves a `resync` out, so a script for new mail never runs on one. `--box`
picks the boxes whose changes are reported; every box is followed regardless, so what is new
is judged across all of them — a reply in The Feed and then a move into the Imbox is not. The
one-liner above is what any desktop does with it; on Omarchy the bar plugin reads the same
lines and sends one batched, replacing toast instead.

The calendars are followed too, by default. A changed event, todo, habit or journal entry
is a `recording_added`, `recording_updated` or `recording_deleted` line naming its
calendar — `{"change":"recording_added","calendar":{"id":512,"name":"Household"},
"recording_id":88001,"recording_type":"Calendar::Event","recording":{}}` — and a calendar
arriving, changing or leaving is `calendar_added`, `calendar_updated` or
`calendar_deleted`. A calendar whose feed fell too far behind is skipped ahead and says so
with `calendar_resync`, the way a box says `resync`. The email-specific flags switch the
calendars off: `--box` scopes the watch to mail, and an `--events` list naming only mail
changes does the same.

A change can drive a command instead of being printed, and there's a choice to make
between two behaviours — pass one or the other, not both. `--run-async` spawns the
command per change and moves on, so a slow one never holds up the watch and two can
overlap. `--run-sync` waits for each and runs them in order, so they never overlap and a
slow one delays the next.

Both hand the JSON to the command on its stdin, and the same fields as `HEY_CHANGE`,
`HEY_AT`, `HEY_BOX_ID`, `HEY_BOX_KIND`, `HEY_BOX_NAME`, `HEY_POSTING_ID` and
`HEY_THREAD_ID`, with `HEY_NEW=1` for new mail and `HEY_NEW=0` otherwise — and on a
calendar line `HEY_CALENDAR_ID`, `HEY_CALENDAR_NAME`, `HEY_RECORDING_ID` and
`HEY_RECORDING_TYPE` instead of the box and posting fields. Both also take over
stdout, so the JSON isn't printed as well.

## Calendars

```bash
hey calendar list                      # list calendars and their IDs
```

`hey calendar list` names the account each calendar belongs to when there is more than one, since
that is what tells two calendars of the same name apart.

Everything a calendar holds is a recording, and each kind has its own command: `hey event`,
`hey todo`, `hey journal`, `hey habit` and `hey timetrack`. The listings that read a
calendar's window share their flags — `--calendar`, `--starts-on`, `--ends-on`, `--limit`
and `--all`. Dates want `YYYY-MM-DD`, and an unreadable one or an `--ends-on` before
`--starts-on` is a usage error rather than an empty result. Naming only `--starts-on` moves
the whole window rather than reading up to the default end.

### Events

```bash
hey event list                    # every calendar, from today onward
hey event list --calendar 123 --starts-on 2026-01-01 --ends-on 2026-01-31
hey event list --count            # how many events in the window

hey event day                     # today as HEY draws it, recurrences expanded
hey event day 2026-09-02          # one day
hey event week 2026-09-02         # the week that day falls in

hey event add "Design review" --starts-on 2026-09-02 --start-time 14:00 --end-time 15:00
hey event add "Sarah's birthday" --starts-on 2026-09-02     # no time, so all day
hey event add "Standup" --start-time 09:15 --repeat every_weekday --remind 10m
hey event edit 4821 --title "Design review (moved)"
hey event edit 4821 --starts-on 2026-09-04 --start-time 15:00
hey event delete 4821
```

Without `--calendar`, `hey event list` reads every calendar and `hey event add` files on
the first one it can — the personal calendar is in the list HEY serves but refuses events.
The list follows every page HEY serves. Within each calendar HEY orders recordings by
newest start time, not creation time, so use the ID returned by `hey event add` for a follow-up
edit or delete rather than choosing an event by its position in the list. A repeating event
lists once as the series it is stored as, not once per day it falls on.

`hey event day` and `hey event week` read a span the way HEY's own views draw it: a
repeating event is expanded into the occurrences that fall inside it, each carrying that
day's own times, an `occurrence_id`, and the id of the series it repeats — which is what
`hey event edit` and `hey event delete` take. A period covers the calendars switched on in
HEY, the same set the app draws, so `day` and `week` take no `--calendar` — only `--limit`
and `--all`. With no date they read the account's own today, whatever zone the machine
runs in.

An event with no `--start-time` is an all-day event, and a `--start-time` with no
`--end-time` runs for an hour. Clock times are read in `--time-zone`, which defaults to the
machine's own zone; without one HEY would read them as UTC.

`hey event edit` changes only the flags you name, but that is this command's doing rather
than HEY's: an event write is a replacement, so the edit reads the event first and sends
back the notes, location, link, attached email, reminders and time zones it is not
changing. Two things cannot survive the round trip. HEY serves notes back as plain text, so
saving flattens their formatting; and a countdown is not served at all, so an edit removes
one unless `--countdown` names it again. An event that cannot be read is refused rather
than written blind — pass the day it starts (`hey event edit 4821 2026-09-02`) or
`--calendar` to look somewhere narrower.

### Todos

```bash
hey todo list                      # list todos
hey todo list --starts-on 2026-01-01 --ends-on 2026-01-31
hey todo add "Buy milk"            # create a todo
hey todo complete 1                # mark done
hey todo uncomplete 1              # mark undone
hey todo delete 1                  # delete
```

### Habits

```bash
hey habit list                      # list habits and their IDs
hey habit list --date 2026-09-02    # the habits in that date's week
hey habit create "Morning strength training"  # create every day with weights and blue defaults
hey habit create "Practice piano" --icon music --color green --days mon,wed,fri
hey habit edit 1 --name "Evening strength training"  # edit only the supplied fields
hey habit edit 1 --days 0,6         # Sunday and Saturday (names also work)
hey habit delete 1                  # permanently delete the habit and its history
hey habit complete 1                # mark habit done (today or --date YYYY-MM-DD)
hey habit uncomplete 1              # undo habit completion
```

`hey habit list` reads the week a date falls in, because habits are not in a calendar's
recordings listing — that carries only their completions. A week lists every habit exactly
once, whatever weekday each is scheduled for. Weekdays use `0` for Sunday through `6` for
Saturday; full names and common abbreviations are accepted too.

### Time tracking

```bash
hey timetrack start                # start tracking
hey timetrack stop                 # stop tracking
hey timetrack stop --category "Client work"   # stop and file it in one request
hey timetrack current              # show active track
hey timetrack list                 # completed tracks, newest first
hey timetrack list --all --json    # every page
hey timetrack list --category 42   # only one category's tracks
hey timetrack edit 1042 --end 2026-08-22T17:30
hey timetrack edit 1042 --category "Client work" --notes "Invoice review"
hey timetrack delete 1042
hey timetrack export > tracked-time.csv
hey timetrack export --output tracked-time.csv
hey timetrack categories           # list categories
hey timetrack category create "Client work"
hey timetrack category rename 123 "Planning"
hey timetrack category delete 123
```

`hey timetrack list` reads HEY's tracked time index: completed tracks, newest-ended first,
with the day, the times, how long each took, the category and the notes. The track that is
running is not in it — `hey timetrack current` is where that lives. One page arrives by
default; `--limit` reads on until it has that many and `--all` reads the lot. `--category`
takes an ID from `hey timetrack categories`.

`hey timetrack edit` changes only the fields whose flags you give. `--start` and `--end`
want `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` in your own time zone, or a full RFC 3339 instant when the zone
matters. A category is given as a title, and HEY creates the category if it has none by
that title — on `edit` and on `stop --category` alike. There is no clearing a category that
way: a blank title leaves the track filed where it was. Editing a track completes it, so
`edit` is for tracks that have already finished.

The time tracking export contains every completed entry, newest first, with Start, End, Duration, Category, and Notes columns. Ongoing time tracking is excluded. `--output` preserves an existing file unless `--force` is set.

Without `--output` the CSV goes to stdout as CSV, so redirecting it to a file is the whole
recipe. The output formatting flags have nothing to reshape there and are refused rather
than ignored: `--json`, `--quiet`, `--markdown`, `--ids-only`, `--count` and `--html` all
need `--output`, which returns file metadata they can format.

### Journal

```bash
hey journal list                   # list entries
hey journal list --starts-on 2026-01-01 --ends-on 2026-01-31
hey journal read                   # read today's entry (or pass YYYY-MM-DD)
hey journal write "..."            # write today's entry (or omit content for $EDITOR)
```

Saving an empty buffer in `$EDITOR` removes the day's entry, and `hey journal write` says
so rather than reporting a save. An empty day answers with an empty entry, so if the read
that pre-fills the editor fails for any other reason the command stops there instead of
opening a blank buffer over an entry it could not see.
